# Odin-Recipe

This project involves the creation of a basic recipe website.

The purpose of this project is to put the knowledge learnt from The Odin Project to the test.

Once complete, I will have demonstrated the use of the following:

- HTML boiler plate
- Heading tags
- Lists
- Links (anchors)
- External CSS style sheet
- Class attribute
